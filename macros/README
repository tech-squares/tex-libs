This directory contains the macro files needed by TeX and LaTeX
and by dvips.  To find them here (assuming your login shell is tcsh):

setenv TEXINPUTS .:/mit/tech-squares/lib/tex/macros:
setenv DVIPSHEADERS $TEXINPUTS

or, with the Bash shell:

export TEXINPUTS=.:/mit/tech-squares/lib/tex/macros:
export DVIPSHEADERS=$TEXINPUTS

Note that the tech-squares Makefiles already do this for you, so you
probably don't have to set these variables.


Most of the tech-squares Makefiles use chained dependencies, which the
Solaris "make" cannot handle.  Run "gmake" to get GNU make, which does
this correctly.


The "ps2pdf" program is in the "gnu" locker; the Makefile finds it
there automatically.  You can also use "distill", in the "acro"
locker, to generate your PDF files.


If you are using xfig or some other drawing program, do not use the
tech-logo-words.eps file here.  Instead, use tech-logo.epsi, found in
the doc/logo directory.

The file doc/lessons/README has even more info about running LaTeX and
printing the results.

How to generate tech-logo-words.pdf:

I'm not sure what the correct way to do this, but I eventually made
this work with:

(grep -E '(PS-Adobe|BoundingBox)' tech-logo-words.eps; cat TechSquares-font2.pro tech-logo-words.eps) | epstopdf -f -o tech-logo-words.pdf
